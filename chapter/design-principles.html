	<p>The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation in team sports through online
    communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this goal if the application is
    not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are applied to achieve a user-centric
    solution.</p>
	
	<h2>User Experience Design</h2>
    
    <p>The term “user experience” was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple (NORMAN, 2013,
    P.XIIIF.). User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its services, and its products. The focus
    and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between
    different disciplines, such as engineering, marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design (NORMAN & NIELSEN,
    N.D.).</p>

    <blockquote> <p>» Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so 
    well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its 
    inadequacies, making itself very noticeable. «</p>

    <p>User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals, the haptics, and the audio 
    to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors: its look, feel, and usability (IXDF - UX
    DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04).</p>
    
    <h3>Look</h3>
    <p>The “look” satisfies the user’s visual expectations of the product. It is about creating a product that is visually appealing
    and conveys the essence of the product to the user. In addition to pure aesthetics, it is also important that the content is 
    communicated simply and understandably. Therefore, it is not only important how the product looks like but also how information 
    is presented.</p>    

    <h3>Feel</h3>
    <p>The “feel” is about creating products that are not only functional but also fun to use. It is important that it is a pleasant 
    and intuitive experience when interacting with the product on a daily basis.</p> 

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>Usability is the cornerstone of user experience because if a product is difficult
    to use, the experience of using it will never be positive. Products should be designed to meet the needs of the user, and the 
    product’s functions should be predictable for the user.</p>
